# BatSAT ðŸ¦‡

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/robsimmons/batsat/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/robsimmons/batsat?branch=main)

BatSAT is a declarative language embedded in JavaScript intended for
procedural content generation.
It aims to reimplement Ian Douglas Horswill's
[CatSAT](https://github.com/ianhorswill/CatSAT) library, which
implements similar functionality in C#.

BatSAT is currently GPL licensed, but if that licensing ends up being
an obstacle for you, let me know!
